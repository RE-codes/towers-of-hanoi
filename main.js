//There should be a function checkWinner that checks to see if the player has won the game. You win the game by putting all the discs back in the original order but on a new peg.

As a helpful hint, we suggest that you test this function with only 3 pegs and 3 discs on the board as it will take significantly less moves to "win".

For now, I'm going to bed...
